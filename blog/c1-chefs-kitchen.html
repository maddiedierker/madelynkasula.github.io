      After watching "Fireside Chat with Shereef: Kitchen vs. Table," I'm only more excited to be at Dev Bootcamp. I truly respect the approach that DBC is taking and I think it perfectly aligns with the experience I want (and need!) to begin my career as a developer. After being unsure of what path I wanted to take, even throughout college, I am finally in a place to take control of my education, and DBC has been a large inspiration in that feeling.

      When I began researching DBC last fall, I didn't know much of anything about programming bootcamps and couldn't really distinguish one from another. I had just moved to Chicago, and once I started going to coding Meet Ups locally, I began hearing more and more about DBC. I became involved with Girl Develop It, and a few very involved members of GDI started out at DBC. Once they described their experiences, I knew it was what I wanted to continue learning to program, especially when it comes to the "soft skills" of being a developer on a daily basis.

      My expectations have only gotten higher since I began DBC. I was hungry and ready to take on everything I could in order to learn as much as possible, and I knew I would have support, but I honestly wasn't expecting the amount of support I have seen thus far. Having a real community of people, teachers, and mentors--even at this stage--is amazing to me. I don't think I have had this much support in all of my educational career--and it's only just beginning!

      When I created my Twitter account this morning, my first tweet (with my lame default Twitter egg avatar) was, "I know I'm still an egg, but one day I'll be a fully grown, badass condor (coder?)." Ignore my bad joke, but it's kind of true. This past week has been the beginning of a growing experience that I know will be difficult, exciting, inspiring, frustrating, and completely worthwhile. And once DBC ends, I have a feeling I'll be ready to fly the nest.
