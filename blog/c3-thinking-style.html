        <h2>growing as abstractly sequential as possible</h2>
        <h4>28 june 2015</h4>
          <p>
            My Gregorc Thinking Style results were: <em>24 CS, 40 AS, 24 AR, 32 CR</em>. My thinking style is mostly Abstract Sequential. I enjoy thinking and working through problems before tackling them (most of the time). I like breaking down complex puzzles into smaller puzzles that can be compounded. I feel challenged when things are disorganized; I don’t mind organizing them first (I kind of enjoy it), but I get kind of frazzled when I feel like there is no order to the problem I’m trying to solve.
          </p>

          <p>
            I took this quiz (or quiz of sorts) the weekend before starting Dev Bootcamp, and, for the first few weeks, I have been noticing how this "Abstract Sequential" style of thinking has been affecting my performance and work within DBC. I have seen many areas where it has helped me excel, and I have seen others where I have been struggling to gain a foothold.
          </p>

          <p>
            First off, I would like to acknowledge that these results have not been the be-all and end-all in any way. It's more of a way in which I like to observe myself and the environment in which I feel most comfortable in my learning.
          </p>

          <p>
            That being said, the "Abstract" part of my learning is helpful in general when learning computer programming, because so much of what we are learning is abstract in nature. Yes, it ties to physical reality, and you can experiment with every aspect of coding in order for it to feel more concrete, but many times your computer (or terminal, or any specific piece of technology with which you are working) can feel like a black box until you truly know its inner workings and many complexities. With this, I am thankful that I tend to grasp abstract information with ease and I find it enjoyable.
          </p>

        <p>
          Now let's talk about "Sequential." I like to call this the absurdly anal, particular side of my inner workings. I thrive in sequential, top-to-bottom, organized environments, and I know that. But nothing is ever as organized as I like it to be, and that part of me is difficult to reconcile within myself (and probably with others, but that is something entirely different).
        </p>

        <p>
          For the first week of DBC, I started at the first challenge, timeboxed myself, and finished each challenge in order from beginning to end. Perfect, done, organized. I was so pleased with myself. Then, I had to start scheduling three pairing sessions along with the challenges. This was perfectly fine (and exciting for me), but it just didn't work in with the sequence I had going on. I would be pairing on challenge 3 on Thursday when I would have ideally finished it on Monday or Tuesday (and believe me, it would have been scheduled immediately when the work for the week was published). This left me feeling frazzled, especially if some of the information in challenge 3 was essential to, say, challenge 6, which I had the time to do earlier in the week. That is honestly how "Sequential" I can get. I like to be organized, and it takes me a minute to cope with disorganization.
        </p>

        <p>
          However, you have to learn to go with the flow with everything in life, so I have focused on not letting any disorganizational hiccups affect my focus and learning. Sometimes I need to be forced to stop being so organized--thriving in a disorganized environment is a very important skill to have because everybody finds themselves there, no matter how much preparation and orderly scheduling they have done to avoid it. As I have been working on cultivating a mindset centered around growth (whereas I felt myself leaning towards a fixed mindset for most of my life), this has been very helpful for me. I am focusing on my journey--not my end goal, bettering myself--not being perfect, and growing as a person--not stagnating as the person "I am supposed to be." And with that, I leave you a great cat meme:
