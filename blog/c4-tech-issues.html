        <h1>intersectionality of race & gender in tech</h1>
        <h4>13 july 2015</h4>

        <p>
          As a woman entering the tech industry, I feel equal amounts of nervous and excited, welcomed and inspected. Anyone entering a field in which they are the minority would feel this way. I also feel this sort of pressure to "prove myself," especially as a non-traditionally learned programmer. However, most of all, I feel fortunate that I am joining a group that by-and-large supports us as newcomers. Reading articles like <a href="https://www.braintreepayments.com/blog/an-open-letter-to-female-programmers/">this</a> simply turn my heart to mush. Still, I feel there is a lot of talk about "women in tech" and not enough about "people of color in tech," especially women. Yes, the umbrella term "diversity in tech" should be all three of these terms, but I feel the latter two are much less visible.
        </p>

        <p>
          When you look for statistics on diversity in tech, you will find ones like <a href="http://www.informationisbeautiful.net/visualizations/diversity-in-tech/">this</a> from Information is Beautiful. The percentage of women is too low, and the percentage of Latino, Black, and Multi-Racial employees is even lower. What this infograph does not show, however, is the percentage of people of color that are women. This is where the problem lies--at the intersectionality of being both female and a person of color.
        </p>

        <p>
          Of course, this is not to say that attention isn't being drawn to the devastatingly low amount of women of color in tech. But the amount of attention to "women," which can sadly turn into "white women," is much more. <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/04/03/women-of-color-in-tech-how-can-we-encourage-them/">This article</a> from Tech Crunch is one of the few headlines I have seen lately targeting women of color specifically. I search and follow countless "Women Who Code"-type Twitter accounts, and they are a very high majority of white women. Why aren't there more organizations like <a href="http://www.blackgirlscode.com/">Black Girls Code</a> and <a href="http://www.yeswecode.org/">#YesWeCode</a>?
        </p>

        <p>
          Per <a href="http://madamenoire.com/520220/why-we-need-more-women-of-color-in-tech/">Madame Noire</a>, "You see, diversity breeds diverse ideas and, ultimately, more revenue. Donâ€™t believe us? Just watch." When you are the definition of a global industry that is in the business of marketing each inhabitant in some way, shape, or form, thoughts like this should be given more weight than they are. How can we create a diverse market when <em>we</em> (meaning the people who build our products) are not diverse? The only way to understand the lens through which someone looks on a daily basis is to have experienced it. Otherwise, you are a bystander.
        </p>

        <p>
          The tech culture is one of <em>doing</em>, not of watching, which is why the lack of emphasis on women of color in technology is nonsensical. But how can you be emphatic and get results when you don't have the power of diversity to attract women of color in the first place? There needs to be incentive. Women in general do not have the incentive to join the tech sphere because we do not have enough people to inspire us to make us <em>think</em> we can do it. It's not an issue of whether we can or cannot, it is an issue of belief in ourselves and motivation to do so.
        </p>

        <p>
          This is why organizations like Black Girls Code are so essential. Give young women of color role models and the tools to break into the tech industry and it will happen. But there needs to be more drive. We need the same amount of drive towards women in tech as we have towards women of color in tech because, as much as we don't want to believe it, those two ideas have become separated in the eyes of the many. Scholarships for gender and racial minorities Dev Bootcamp like those recently sponsored by #YesWeCode and Braintree are needed for those of us that are unable to afford amazing opportunities like Dev Bootcamp. Hark work and opportunity are essential to success in this industry. Without hard work, you will never make it. Without opportunity, you will leave before you even get the chance.
