        <p>
          Before Dev Bootcamp, I had never done any pair programming. For the first couple of weeks I felt nervous and self-conscious about pairing because I was with new people, showcasing a skill that, although I had been working on it on my own for a while, was still relatively new. However, I have had great experiences so far in my pairing sessions, and I have learned a lot about my own learning style, communication skills, and technical skills.
        </p>

        <p>
          I think my favorite part about pairing is the sharing of knowledge with each other. We all have our own way of doing things, methods we really like to utilize, small tricks that we've learned along the way--I love sharing these things with others and learning something new every time I pair with someone. There have been so many times where I would have been stuck on a small part of a problem, whereas it was something my pair was either seeing differently or had encountered before, and they were there to explain and take the lead. After that, I know when I come across something similar, I will remember and be able to do the same for someone else who is having trouble! I have paired with people who know other programming languages but are less familiar with Ruby (whereas Ruby is my primary language), and I have enjoyed showing them useful tricks with Ruby methods and syntax while they bring a different perspective and creative solution to the table. This, along with being one of the most enjoyable aspects of pair programming, is a reason companies utilize it as well--having someone to check your work, add value, and take over where their knowledge is deeper, are all great reasons to pair in a company environment.
        </p>

        <p>
          Honestly, the only frustrating experiences up to this point have been a result of my own lack of communication, which is something I am working on. I have had pairing sessions where I am navigating and I notice that the driver is heading in the wrong direction. At that point, I will let them know that I think we should be going in x-direction, and why. But if the driver disagrees with my opinion (which can be a good thing--what if my hunch to change directions is totally wrong?), it's hard for me to keep pushing my opinion, even when I know something is wrong. I feel like I am being pushy or rude and that my pair will think I don't respect their programming style, technical choices, etc. I also begin to question myself: "What if I am totally wrong and I am pushing this idea that won't work? Maybe I should just let them keep going and see what happens?"
        </p>

        <p>
          On the other side, I have had the same experience before as the driver. I have worked with people who, when they navigate, completely take over typing when they think my solution is wrong. (Mind you, this has happened very rarely.) There have also been times when I am completely off track and the navigator says, "Yeah, I was going to say we should do it this way, but I wanted to see if your way worked." (Obviously the same sort of approach I have taken.) In the latter case, I feel like my opinion is more respected, but I also feel almost guilty that the navigator did not want to voice his or her opinion at the time and I ended up wasting half of our pairing session! These are both edge cases that have happened rarely while pairing, but can definitely be frustrating or discouraging in the moment.

          That brings us to writing and receiving feedback on pairing sessions. For the most part, writing feedback has been kind of difficult. While it's easy to tell someone that you enjoyed pairing with them, it can be difficult to explain (in a kind way) when you were frustrated. (Again, going back to me working on communication!) I have sat at my computer and tried to think of feedback for a difficult pairing session for far too long at times. In the end, I explain why I was frustrated, explaining what exactly it was that made me feel like I was not respected or being listened to, but I can never tell if I'm being "too kind" and not getting the point across. Meta-feedback (feedback for my feedback) has been helpful because it gives me an outsider's perspective--am I giving constructive feedback that is still kind? Honestly, the more I get used to pairing in general, the easier it is to express my feelings about a pairing session. At the beginning it seemed as though I almost didn't have the vocabulary to be able to tell someone how I felt about the challenge we worked on together.

          Receiving feedback has been very helpful as well because it has brought up some unexpected results! In the beginning, I had a couple of reviews that told me to basically "not be afraid to voice my opinion," while these were coming from a week of pairing where I had felt I had almost been too assertive in my opinion. It felt good to know that I had not been too pushy with my pair, but I was definitely not expecting them to tell me to voice how I felt even more than I already had. After that, I became more comfortable with navigating and, even while driving, I will be more clear about what I am going to do before I even write any code. Lately, however, the feedback I have gotten has been pretty similar and less constructive than I would like. I have been lucky the past few weeks to have paired with people that I have just clicked with--our discussions are fruitful, we have a clear idea of how we want to solve the problem, when we run into coding issues we are on the same page and can talk easily about our confusion and changes that need to be made. This is obviously a great thing, but our feedback (on both ends) has been less actionable because we almost have nothing negative to say about our pairing session. One of my main goals at DBC is to improve myself as much as possible, so I like actionable feedback that allows me to better understand what it is like to work with me, what environments I work best in, and where I need to improve technically. This is why I am excited to be on-site, pairing more often and in-person, so that I can continue to hone in these skills and become a world-class beginner.
