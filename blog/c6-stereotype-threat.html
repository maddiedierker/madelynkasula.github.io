        <h1>stereotype threat</h1>
        <h4>26 july 2015</h4>

        <p>
          Stereotype threat affects everybody in different ways (obviously based upon the stereotypes about your gender, race, background, et cetera). As a female student, I have experienced stereotype threat in various environments throughout my life, especially as a STEM student in college.
        </p>

        <p>
          Throughout college, I studied chemistry and mathematics, took plenty of biology courses, a couple of computer science classes, and my fair share of physics. That was all I did for my first three years of college--pure science and math. I avoided the humanities like the plague until, one day, I became dissatisfied with my role as a female STEM student. I felt so much extra pressure to prove myself, to somehow show that I was a "real scientist" rather than a rule-abiding student, a motherly teacher who was always available to teach the (white) men, who were the real scientists that I so longed to be.
        </p>

        <p>
          I felt uncomfortable speaking up in class. Any time I had a question, I waited desperately until someone else asked, then I would end up researching it on my own in private. I studied myself to exhaustion because I knew I could be at the top of my class, but I didn't feel the entitlement that led me to believe that I actually deserved it. When I did poorly, I secretly thought it was because I didn't belong; I wasn't a chemist, a mathematician, a physicist--I was a resource for everyone else. I loved my discipline, but I couldn't reconcile it with myself as a young, white female. My anxiety about failing was so directly tied to this that I couldn't continue to lie to myself--I didn't belong here (something I would later regret).
        </p>

        <p>
          So, I finished my major requirements as fast as possible, and committed myself to the humanities. I began writing more and finished an English literature and writing major in one year. This world of creativity I had joined was a breath of fresh air--there were more people "like me" (i.e., people who identified as female), I felt like my opinion mattered, my failure-centered anxiety disappeared. Still, I wasn't happy. I was (and still am) a scientist at heart. I was enjoying expressing the creative side of myself that I so little saw, but I wanted the hard analytics of running analytical tests on a batch of crystals I had spent three weeks purifying. I wanted to spend so much time solving calculus problems that I forgot how to do anything else. I wanted to be amazed by physics and its applications.
        </p>

        <p>
          By that point, I was at the end of my college career, and I was none the wiser about how to solve my problem with stereotype threat. I had, however, become attracted to computer science and programming--something that I had taken for granted as a fun hobby while in university. So, in my free time, I continued to learn. I researched the technical sphere and moved to Chicago. I found amazing groups of women like Girl Develop It and Women Who Code who are pushing these boundaries of stereotype threat in STEM fields. I signed up for Dev Bootcamp and told myself that I wouldn't let the fear of failing because of my gender hold me back. And here I am.
