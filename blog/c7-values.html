        <h1>affirmation & stereotype threat</h1>
        <h4>4 august 2015</h4>

        <p>
          Throughout my life, I have always valued independence and self-reliance. My mom has always joked that I "walked out of the womb and straight to adulthood." I take pride in knowing that I can take care of myself (and I like to think I can help take care of others, too). This isn't to say that I refuse help when I need it--I also value honesty and try to recognize when I truly need the help of others rather than allowing myself to drown. The latter values are more difficult to reconcile with because I can be stubborn or ignorant of my own situation in order to realize that I do need someone else's help, but that is something I work on daily.
        </p>

        <p>
          Outside of personal qualities that I value, I want to also create meaningful work and be challenged. My tendencies lean towards perfectionism (extremely), so I try to do the best work I possibly can, sometimes to the point of obsession. That is because I want and need to be challenged--if I don't feel challenged, I quickly get bored and can let myself get lazy because I don't have the fire under me to keep me working hard. This means I tend to take on large, arduous endeavors in order to constantly feel like I have something to challenge me. Then I put my independence to use, and try to make sure I am being honest with myself throughout the process. A lot of times I bite off more than I can chew, but I would rather be pushed too hard than not pushed at all.
        </p>

        <p>
          Knowing these things about myself and what I value helps a lot in recognizing stereotype threat. Many of those values actually stem from stereotype threat; as a woman in a scientific field, I don't want to be seen as weak, so I try to be as autonomous as possible while being self-aware of how I am doing both intellectually and emotionally (Am I creating good work? Am I doing my best? Am I happy?). This self-awareness can be overwhelming at times because I am constantly evaluating my performance and health to make sure I don't fall into the "woman pretending to be a scientist but actually isn't good enough" stereotype threat that I always feel pressure from. I make sure to remind myself as much as possible about why I feel threatened and why I value the things that I do--I hope that someday stereotype threats are challenged and disproved enough that they are no longer pressures looming over us, making us compromise our values and our potential.
