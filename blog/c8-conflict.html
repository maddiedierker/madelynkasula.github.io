        <h1>conflict</h1>
        <h4>9 august 2015</h4>

        <p>
          One of the most notable conflicts I have dealt with (and I'm sure most people have at some point) was with my partner. I was the more obsessively cleanly of the two of us, whereas he just wanted his belongings to be straightened-up and in their place--that was his version of clean. Mine was a dust-free, cat hair-less, shining version of that. This was a silent argument for far too long, where I would scrub the entire apartment on a weekend morning while he was out of the house (usually climbing or running, so he was gone for the entire length of time).
        </p>

        <p>
          This meant he would come home to a perfectly clean house, never having seen the work that went into it. For a long time this didn't bother me--I'm not doing anything this morning, I want to spend time with him (not cleaning) when he gets back, I am much better at cleaning and it won't take me long, etc. But he, for the most part, wouldn't acknowledge my work (because he, unknown to me, genuinely did not notice). After so long, this wore me down. I wasn't his caretaker, and I felt my time deserved to be spent in much more enjoyable ways like his was. So I stopped.
        </p>

        <p>
          I stopped a short while after we moved to Chicago and into our new apartment. I was busy with work, learning to code in my free time, and meeting new friends in a new city. I didn't want to spend my weekends cleaning our apartment, even though it drove me crazy to come home and see tumbleweeds of cat hair drifting over the wooden floor. Then, one day, he made a comment about always being the one to clean the house. I was honestly baffled, and conflict instantly began. (Mind you, we are not people who argue or hold grudges--any time a problem comes up, we almost immediately talk it through rather than letting it get this far.)
        </p>

        <p>
          Of course I sang my sad song about always cleaning up after him. Then he said his side of the story--how he usually did our laundry (especially folding it, which I despise doing), cooked for us more often, went grocery shopping when I forgot or didn't have time to go, straightened up around the house. And I felt horrible for holding this strange, vague grudge towards him when there were so many other factors I wasn't taking into account. He did his part and I did mine--none was more worthy of our time. We were both working towards the same goal, but I was seeing it as a butting of heads.
        </p>

        <p>
          We finally rationalized why we had been feeling annoyed with each other: we want our time to be respected, we want to feel appreciated and not taken for granted, we want to feel like equals and partners rather than some sort of domestic slave to each other. It was that simple. And it took nearly 3 years for it to get to the point where we would actually talk to each other about it because we didn't know how to verbalize and explain our feelings. Once we talked about it, we were so much more aware of the things we did for each other, and made a point to acknowledge that and thank each other. Long story short, even people who talk through their problems and work through them as partners can easily begin holding secret grudges without even noticing, until it becomes a more serious problem. Recognizing your feelings, verbalizing them to yourself, then explaining them to the other person is the only way I know to keep myself from getting to the point of conflict.
