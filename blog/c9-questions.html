        <p>
          Asking good questions is primarily about context--personal, circumstantial, and--in the case of programming questions--technical. In order to ask a good question, you have to let your reader in on this context in order to get any sort of useful feedback, troubleshooting, advice, or other type of answer. If you are unable to properly convey this information, asking questions can become more of a headache than a help.
        </p>

        <p>
          Every time I ask a question on a public forum, I try to read my post as a complete outsider before I submit it. My question is essentially completely anonymous if it is posted on a site like StackOverflow, so any reader that comes upon my question has zero insight about my background as a programmer. If it's an easy question like, "I am trying to reverse a string in JavaScript. Here is what I have so far. What am I doing wrong or missing?" where I can post a block of code and have it procure a simple answer, that is probably all that is needed. On the other hand, if I'm running into a debugging problem with strange errors and I am working with unfamiliar APIs or a new codebase, I would need to go much more into why it is I am having difficulty; I should mention my level of knowledge on the subject in order to let readers know how to react--maybe it is a really complex problem that I didn't know I was getting involved in, and I need someone with more experience to let me know that... or maybe it's a simple solution that I am just unfamiliar with.
        </p>

        <p>
          That's what makes asking good questions so difficult--it depends on the question you are asking, and you need to be able to determine how much outside information to give in order to get the outcome you need or desire. As a personal example, I was running into a problem with git during one of our first weeks at Dev Bootcamp. I posted the following question:
        </p>

        <p>
          "Is anyone else having trouble with the pad_spec.rb file for the Pad an Array challenge? It's not running (or possibly running very slowly) for me. I tested a bunch of the other rspec files and they're working fine, so I was wondering if anyone else is having this problem!ï»¿"
        </p>

        <p>
          The only response I got was a fellow student asking if I had somehow created an infinite loop, which was definitely a good place to start (us being very new to this and all). My question failed for several reasons: I didn't explain in enough detail what the problem was, I should have (and very easily could have) posted a picture of my code for easier troubleshooting, and, instead of just asking for help, I asked if anyone was having the same issue. Since nobody else was having that problem, they probably wrote my question off because it suddenly didn't involve them. Something as simple as stating, "I'm stuck, I need some troubleshooting help, here is my problem and the code I am working with/having trouble with," would have made my question much more relevant and clear. I did eventually solve the problem on my own, but that isn't always going to be the case when I run into issues, and if communicating my problems and questions I have is difficult, then solving those problems will become even more of an issue! After I realized how fruitless that question was, I have been much more careful (as I originally stated--looking at my question as a complete outsider with no personal knowledge of the situation) and meticulous in my question asking. Being in a field such as software engineering means learning new things and working in unfamiliar territory constantly, so being able to be constructive, concise, and clear with your questions will make all of the difference when you're stuck debugging a single line of code for 3 hours!
