        <h1>margins, borders, & padding in css</h1>
        <h4>21 june 2015</h4>
              <p>
                This week, we worked on HTML and CSS to learn some design skills. I only have prior experience with small bits of HTML and larger bits of backend work, so it was mostly new to me, especially (and most frustratingly) CSS.
              </p>

              <p>
                An important aspect of understanding positioning in CSS is looking at an object's size. CSS uses the "box model" in order to make these sizes as clear as possible. However, I found myself getting margins, borders, and padding mixed up, and I found the diagram below to be most helpful to visualize:
              </p>

              <p>
                Here, you can see that your content itself--text, a picture, etc.--is the smallest value and represents the meat (i.e., content) of what you want to show. In order to style and position this content however you want, you can add padding, a border, and a margin to do so.
              </p>

              <p>
                I like to think of it this way: Say I have a picture. I want to have a border around this picture. However, I don't necessarily want this border to be directly flush against my picture, and I don't necessarily want the border to be directly flush against the content next to it. Hence why <em>both</em> padding and margin are needed (this was where I was originally getting confused, wondering, <em>Why would I need padding if I have margins?</em>). It's like having a picture on your wall--you add padding around the photo for effect against the border (picture frame, in this case), then you adjust the margins outside of your border to display with other pictures.
              </p>

              <p>
                I found <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/css/css_boxmodel.asp">this article</a> most helpful as a quick guide as well. See the screenshots below as examples for how I practiced as well! I start with a 200x200 pixel box, add margins, add a border, and add padding. (You'll notice when you add padding, it looks like the box "grows"... Why is that?) Doing this with text helped a lot as well.
              </p>

                If you are having trouble with CSS, I hope this helps!
