        <h1>arrays & hashes</h1>
        <h2>to use, or not to use</h2>
        <h4>28 june 2015</h4>

          <p>
            As a new programmer, deciding how you want to store data and, once you or someone else stores that data, figuring out how to properly manipulate it can be slow to start. Two of the most popular constructs to store data in Ruby are arrays and hashes. But how do you decide which to use for the data you're working with?
          </p>

          <p>
            To keep it simple, I first ask myself the question, <em>Will you be storing the data itself, or will that data be associated with something else?</em> That is obviously over-simplified, but if I have a set of data that is just a massive list of that data that is contained within itself, I know I will most likely want to use an array to store all of that information. However, if I have data in which each piece of information <em>means something more than itself or has no meaning by itself</em>, I will use a hash. Let me explain with some examples.
          </p>

          <p>
            I have some friends and I want to store their information. For each friend, I have their name and phone number. Would I use an array? Let's look at it:
          </p>

          <code>
            friend_information = ["Alex", 7738543098, "Mandi", 9038590859, "Maddie", 8594039003]
          </code>

          <p>
            And so on. I would either have to do that, or do the following:
          </p>

          <code>
            alex_information = ["Alex", 7738543098]<br>
            mandi_information = ["Mandi", 9038590859]<br>
            maddie_information = ["Maddie", 8594039003]
          </code>

          <p>
            In the first case, how am I ever supposed to access this information? Memorize the index at which each piece of information is stored? Or have hundreds (not to over-exaggerate my amount of friends) of variables to store each person separately? Thank you, but no.
          </p>

          <p>
            If we were to use a hash, it would look like this:
          </p>

          <code>
            friend_information = {"Alex" => 7738543098, "Mandi" => 9038590859, "Maddie" => 8594039003}
          </code>

          <p>
            This way, if I want to look up Alex's phone number, I can do so by using his name as the key (for which the value is his phone number). The phone number means nothing without its association with the person to whom it belongs, so a hash is useful for this association. If I just wanted to store the names of all of my friends, I would use an array (so I could look at it lovingly and think of my friends and how awesome they are).
          </p>

          <p>
            There you have it--the most definitive explanation of arrays and hashes! (If only... But it's definitely the fastest way for me to distinguish which I should be using!) I found <a href="http://www.sitepoint.com/guide-ruby-collections-ii-hashes-sets-ranges/">this article</a> and <a href="http://www.sitepoint.com/guide-ruby-collections-part-arrays/">this one</a> from New Relic to be very useful as well, so check them out. Then we can both store our friends' names in arrays and compare whose is longer, but we both know it's about quality, not quantity, which an array can't really distinguish (yet). Maybe a hash could? Try it and let me know.
