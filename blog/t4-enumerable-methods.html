        <p>
          This week, we have been working on more in-depth Ruby concepts, such as learning more about the Enumerable module and creating methods in Ruby. Per the Ruby documentation site, here is the definition for Enumerable:
        </p>

        <blockquote cite="http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.2.2/Enumerable.html">
          <em>The Enumerable mixin provides collection classes with several traversal and searching methods, and with the ability to sort. The class must provide a method each, which yields successive members of the collection. If Enumerable#max, #min, or #sort is used, the objects in the collection must also implement a meaningful <=> operator, as these methods rely on an ordering between members of the collection.</em>
        </blockquote>

        <p>
          Easy, right? I'm still getting used to documentation, so I did some research on the <a href="http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.2.2/Enumerable.html#method-i-map">#map</a> method because I have yet to use it much, but hear wondrous tales of its powers. Here is my basic understanding: the Enumerable module is an "add-on" (Ruby-doc calls it a "mixin," which is another fun name) that contains features for you to use. If you include the Enumerable module in your class, you get all of those great features (via inheritance). As for Enumerable specifically, <a href="http://www.eriktrautman.com/posts/ruby-explained-map-select-and-other-enumerable-methods">Erik Trautman's blog post</a> explained it well:
        </p>

        <blockquote cite="http://www.eriktrautman.com/posts/ruby-explained-map-select-and-other-enumerable-methods">
          <em>As long as the class that wants to include Enumerable has its own #each method that Enumerable can use, it can get access to all the magic and joy of using the Enumerable methods by simply mixing it in.</em>
        </blockquote>

        <p>
          Now that we know about Enumerable, let's talk about its method #map. (Also keep in mind that #map has an identical method called #collect. However, from my understanding, #map is the "universal" way to go, if that's even a real thing.) Think of #map as taking your array and/or hash, passing new information into it (via a code block), and changing your original data structure to contain this new information.
        </p>

        <p>
          Let's look at an example. My friends submit a form to me with some of their information. I am a terrible programmer and didn't format their names a certain way from the beginning, so now I want to make sure they all look nice so I can send them beautifully formatted mass emails. (Sorry this example is getting so convoluted, but that's my friends' faults.) I want to take my array of friends and map over each of their names to make sure they are output correctly:
        </p>

        <code>
          friends = ["MANDI", "alex", "Denise", "MiKe", "SLoAne"]<br>
          friends.map { |name| name.capitalize }
        </code>

        <p>
          Much better. Now I can present these friends to the world, where their names will look like so:
        </p>

        <code>
          ["Mandi", "Alex", "Denise", "Mike", "Sloane"]
        </code>

        <p>
          Be careful, because #map itself is not "destructive" where it will write over the original information in your data structure. If you want to alter your hash/array forever (gasp!), use #map! or reset your <code>friend</code> variable to equal its new, mapped self (i.e., <code>friend = friend.map {|name| name. capitalize }</code>). In summation, either give your friends a stern talking about the rules of name capitalization in the English language, or learn to use #map.
