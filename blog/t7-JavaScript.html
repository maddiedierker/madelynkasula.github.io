        <h1>ruby v. javascript</h1>
        <h2>a great debate</h2>
        <h4>4 august 2015</h4>

        <p>
          Let me start of by making it clear that calling this conversation "a great debate" is not serious. Now that we have that out of the way, we can discuss Ruby versus JavaScript--specifically, looping in the two languages. While both Ruby and JavaScript have (for the most part) very similar syntax and rules for different types of loops, there is one type of loop in particular that JavaScript utilizes that I wish were more conventional in Ruby: the <code>for</code> loop.
        </p>

        <p>
          Yes, Ruby has this loop, but it's not "the Ruby way"--that is, like many things in Ruby, it exists but is not recommended by Ruby enthusiasts. My experience with JavaScript is far less than that with Ruby, but the <code>for</code> loop has done me well thus far. Maybe this is due to my foray into Java during college, where I used all sorts of fun <code>for</code> loops, but that's neither here nor there. I would also like to mention that it is specifically the syntax for this loop in JavaScript, not necessarily its being more useful than any other loop in Ruby, that is pleasing to me for so many reasons.
        </p>

        <p>
          Let's say you want to iterate through an array. In Ruby, you would most likely use #each or #map for whatever your purpose is to iterate over said array. And, I will admit, these built-in methods in Ruby (along with so many other obvious features) are simpler and, in many cases, more useful. But there is something so satisfying about reading code that says: "For each index in my array, starting at the first index and ending at the last, I want to do..."
        </p>

        <code>
          for (i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {</br>
            console.log(array[i]);
          };</br>
        </code>

        <p>
          Maybe I am crazy, but I think that is beautiful code! It's the declaration statement at the beginning of the loop--I want to start here, I want to end here, and I want to do this between my beginning and end points. It lays it all out for you--no need to look at the rest of the loop to know that you will be performing said task. Yes, Ruby's #each method does the same thing without the extra verbosity in JavaScript, but writing a nice <code>for</code> loop just feels right (again, I go back to Java, which is the first programming language I had ever encountered). It is simple, infinitely useful, and unencumbered by other choices (in Ruby, I constantly search for other ways I could be accomplishing my task to the point where I think of too many options sometimes!). And that is the only good thing I have to say about JavaScript. Otherwise, it's Ruby all day for this woman!
